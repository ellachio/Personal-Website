                <p>I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Cebu. 
                    My journey in this field has been fueled by a passion for technology and a desire to explore its creative possibilities.
                    Beyond the world of code and algorithms, I find joy in various forms of art and entertainment. <b>Music</b> is a significant part of my life.
                    I enjoy playing instruments, <b>singing,</b> and <b>dancing.</b> I'm also fascinated by the storytelling power of films, 
                    which has inspired me to delve into <b>photography,</b> <b>videography,</b> and <b>editing.</b>
                    In the realm of technology, I'm drawn to the intersection of design and functionality.
                    My interests in <b>UI/UX Design</b> and <b>Web and App Development</b> drive my aspirations to become a successful professional in these areas.
                    Though my professional experience is still developing, I've been actively involved in projects, including App Development work during my time in school. 
                    Additionally, I offer freelance services in video editing and filming, honing my skills while contributing to various creative endeavors.
                    Currently, I'm focused on building a diverse portfolio that showcases my skills and creativity. 
                    My goal is to leave a lasting impression through my work, whether it's designing intuitive user interfaces or crafting seamless digital experiences.
                    As you explore my portfolio, I hope you'll see not only my technical abilities but also my passion and dedication to my craft.
                    I aim to inspire and connect with others through my creative journey, leaving a meaningful impact in the digital landscape.
